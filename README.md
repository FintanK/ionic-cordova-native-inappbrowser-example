# Ionic Native Browser Example

This app serves as an example of how we can package a hybrid mobile application that can be installed as a native app on a users device and themed.

When the app is opened the splash screen appears and the home page is shown as a placeholder.

The app then redirects to a custom URL and the native app works like a normal browser within the native app.

Essentially you can theme your native app for Android and IOS but when it is loaded it points at whatever website you want.

It's a very simple concept but useful for decentralised applications built on IPFS which can URL / hash frequently.

Once deployed to the app stores the app can be updated remotely without resubmissions using Ionic Deploy
